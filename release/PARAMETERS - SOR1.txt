1	// FACING WHEN HIT - when got hit, face to the hitter
1	// REALIST FACING WHEN HIT - when got hit, face to the point where it was hit, rather than just to the hitter

26	// LIFEBAR


10.	// VELOCITY DIVIDER		- shouldn't be changed
4.	// ROTATIONAL VEL DIVIDER	- shouldn't be changed




0.5	// VERTICAL VEL FACTOR	 - it moves slower when moving up/down

0.2	// AIR CONTROL	- moving when jumping
0.1	// JUMP IMPULSE FACTOR - how much of the "walk/run" speed is given when jump
0.5	// ELASTICITY	- how much of the previous speed is keep after bounce

20	// RUN TIME - the maximum time interval to accept 2 forward keys as a running move
12	// ATTACK TIME - the maximum time interval to accept the next combo in a row

40	// KNOCK TIME - the time required to hold the knocking key in order to activates the knock move

18	// GRAB X SPACE - the maximum space between characters to accept a grab, in the X axis
0.	// GRAB X BACK FACTOR - how much of the grab x space is considered when wrong faced

12	// GRAB Y SPACE - the maximum space between characters to accept a grab, in the Z axis



-0.2	// GRAVITY

1.5	// FALLING LIMIAR	- the minimum speed to considere that a character is in descendent move
0.25	// MINIMUM FLIP ATTACK	- when flip over someone, you can do throw attack (skate for example) after passing this time

0.75	// MAXIMUM FLIP ATTACK	- when flip over someone, you can only do a throw attack until this time passes

3.	// JUMP SPECIAL MAX SPEED - maximum air Y speed to still allow a jump special.

5	// HIT PAUSE	- time that character pauses when hit someone
5	// KNOCK PAUSE	- time that character pauses when knocks someone
12	// GRAB_PAUSE	- time that character have to wait before grab, after hitting someone
5	// AFTER_ATTACK_PAUSE - time to wait before move, after an attack move

15	// RECOVER TIME	- time to ignore hits when recovering from a knock (invincible state for few time)
25	// UNGRAB TIME	- time needed before ungrab when pressing back


1	// GROUND BOUNCE VEL - Y velocity given when character bounces on the ground

2	// KNOCKED X VEL - velocity applyed on a knock, in x axis
3	// KNOCKED Y VEL - velocity applyed on a knock, in y axis

-2.5	// BLOCK HIT VEL  - velocity applied when being hit during a block
5	// BLOCK HIT TIME - time to move back when being hit during a block
